Brief Description:)
The Counter App is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical counter. It supports dynamic step sizes for changes and allows the counter value to go into negative numbers. This app was built to practice React fundamentals, state management, and user interaction handling.
